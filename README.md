# pySALEUI
an ipython notebook-based UI wrapper for pySALESetup

# NB
In order to get jupyter notebook running (I kept encountering a 'connecting to kernel' message),
I had to downgrade the python module tornado from version 6.0 to 5.1.1. This is easily done with the
following command:

pip install --upgrade tornado==5.1.1

I had this problem on Mac using python3.
